<i>legal: the undoing of God's Law [1893 Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, E=
ncyclopedia Britannica, a dictionary of arts, sciences and general literatu=
re / The R.S Peale 9th 1893]</i><br><br>
but is this "accurate" or merely an interpretation of what was read by anot=
her from that source?<br><br>=20

Well, time will tell as I am to head on over to University of Central Flori=
da for my own examination as this University has an electronic version I ca=
n view and this is the closest location for the source material.<br><br>
Until then, I present my findings just through a one day jaunt around town =
and update this page to espouse on any future findings: either from myself =
or from what others present with respect to this subject matter.<br><br>
I just happen to live near Stetson Universtity, Florida's first law school =
and currently one of the top schools nationally for "legal writing", whatev=
er that means, but it does allow me access to one of the finest law librari=
es in the State and right across the bay: University of South Florida. So, =
we begin here.<br><br>
I scanned a few pages from some dictionaries, corpus juris secundum, and re=
ad some of american jurisprudence. I will link up the scans are the end of =
the document so you can download them; one zip file for convienence. So, he=
re are my findings regarding the word <b><i>"legal"</i></b>:<br><br>

<b>various other views on <i>"legal"</i>:</b>
<ul style=3D"list-style-type:none">
<li>Ark. 1960. "Legal" means of or pertaining to law; arising out of, or by=
 virute of, or included in law; based on or governed by law.-Roberts v.
Love, 333 S.W.2d 897, 231 Ark. 886, certiorari denied 81 S.Ct. 64, 364 U.S.=
 825, 5 L.Ed.2d 55.</li>
<li><br>Kan. 1932. The word "legal" means conforming to law, according to l=
aw, required or permitted by law, not forbidden or discountenanced by law. =
The
word also means good and effectual in law.-Freeman v. Fowler Packing Co., 1=
1 P.2d 276, 135 Kan. 378.</li>
<li><br>La. 1962. There are three kinds of "compensation": (1) "legal", whi=
ch is effected by mere operation of law, (2) "contractual", which is effect=
ed by
will of parties, and (3) "judicial", which is effected by courts. LSA-C.C. =
arts. 2130 et seq., 2207, 2210, subd. 1.-Tolbird v. Cooper, 143 So.2d 80, 2=
43 La.
306.-set-Off</li>
<li><br>La.App.Orleans 1935. The term "legal" means that which is according=
 to law.-Beard v. Rickert Rice Mills, 164 So. 636, set aside 168 So. 492, 1=
85
La. 55.</li>
<li><br>Mo.App. 1909. The term "legal" means that which is according to law=
.-Vaughn v. NationalCouncil Junior Order United American Mechanics,
117 S.W. 115, 136 Mo.App. 362.</li>
<li><br>Neb. 1978. Principal distinction between terms "lawful" and "legal"=
 is that former contemplates substance of law, and latter the form of law; =
to say
of an act that it is "lawful" implies that it is authorized, sanctioned, or=
 at any rate not forbidden by law; to say that it is "legal" implies that i=
t is
done or performed in accordance with forms and usages of law, or in technic=
al manner. R.R.S.1943, ?28-736.-state v. Reeves, 261 N.W.2d 110, 199
Neb. 725.-Escape 1.</li>
<li><br>N.J.Err. &amp; App. 1905. "Legal" is defined as according to the pr=
inciple of law; according to the method required by statute; by means of ju=
dicial
proceedings.-In re Folwell's Estate, 62 A. 414, 68 N.J.Eq. 728, 2 L.R.A.N.S=
. 1193.</li>

So, there we have it: The results from my awesome one day research mission =
into the word <b><i>"legal"</i></b>, I traversed two counties, shuffled thr=
ough 10's of books and spent exactly 15 cents on copies as Stetson Law and =
USF both have copy machines that allow me to copy directy to thumbdrive; Gu=
lfport library: not so technically advanced, and USF copy machine laser sca=
ns the open book; fucking awesome, I want one.<br><br>
All of this and I still have yet to find that quote referenced at the begin=
ning of this article, but I did uncover that <b><i>"legal"</i></b> is law b=
ut is contrasted with equity which is equality, so <b><i>"legally"</i></b>,=
 the law must not be equal in its application as equity would not exist if =
legal was equal for "the inclusion of one is the exclusion of another" sinc=
e <b><i>"legal"</i></b> is just form, not substance of the "law".<br><br>
Furthermore, <b><i>"legal"</i></b> is also more concerned of the measuremen=
t of the works of a man and not his faith nor grace which means, "by your w=
orks you shall be known", <b><i>"legally"</i></b>, but according to Ephesia=
ns Chapter 2: 8-10 (WORD OF GOD under PUBLIC LAW):
<ul style=3D"list-style-type:none">
<li>8 <mark>For by grace are ye saved through faith</mark>; and that not of=
 yourselves: [it is] the gift of God:</li>
<li>9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.</li>
<li>10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works,=
 which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</li>
</ul>
From ROMANS we find:
<ul style=3D"list-style-type:none">
<li>3:20 because by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His =
sight; for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.</li>
<li><br>3:28 For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from wo=
rks of the Law.</li>
<li><br>4:3 For what does the Scripture say? =E2=B2=A1ham believed God, and=
 it was credited to him as righteousness.?/li&gt;
</li><li><br>5:1 Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace w=
ith God through our Lord Jesus Christ,</li>
</ul> =20
From JAMES we find:
<ul style=3D"list-style-type:none">
<li>2:24 You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.</=
li>
<li><br>2:26 For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also afait=
h without works is dead.</li>
</ul> =20

However, since <b><i>"legal"</i></b> also appears to be more concerned with=
 "Old Testament" or "Mosiac Law" (law of moses), then it does make sense th=
at under the "law", one does not receive Grace; Grace is "New Testament", t=
hus it is my conclusion that should one walk in faith with the whole of God=
's Law, then one's works or fruit done in exercise of that faith should ful=
fill any <b><i>"legal obligations"</i></b> and one shall receive GRACE: leg=
ally and illegally.<br><br>

But as far as the quote referenced at the beginning of this article, I am b=
eing led to believe <b><i>"legal"</i></b> is not the undoing of God's Law, =
per se, but <b><i>excessive adherence to law or formula</i></b>, from what =
I have witnessed, will result in a form of FUNDAMENTALISM of which appears =
to lead people down the road of EXTREMISM of which results in TERRORISM bec=
ause to be 100% <b><i>"legal"</i></b> means STRICT <b><i>"adherence to the =
Law rather than to the Gospel, the doctrine of justification by works"</i><=
/b> of which appears to be a rejection of God in favor of Man as God: Satan=
ism ... Man as JUDGE, JURY, and EXECUTIONER without grace, forgiveness, nor=
 mercy.<br><br>
Just like every other religion ... or cult.<br><br>
So, for now, the LEGAL WAIVER shall remain.
