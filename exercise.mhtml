I came across this article while browsing thru the "chicken little sites" I=
 frequent and thought I would pass it along as there is also a few audios f=
or your enjoyment. <a href=3D"http://educate-yourself.org/cn/Al-Thompson-Sc=
hools-US-Attorney-in-Definition-of-Perjury14feb16.shtml#top" target=3D"_bla=
nk">Click here for the article</a><br><br>
The premise here is shifiting the burden of proof onto the accusor. The aut=
hor uses the phrase <i>"what facts do you have "these laws" apply to me?"</=
i> (basically challenging jurisdiction) and this should put the Kibosh on 9=
9% of the problems people are facing. <br><br>
<i>"what facts do you have the vehicle code applies to me?"</i><br><br>
<i>"what facts do you have the IRS code applies to me?"</i><br><br>
<i>"what facts do you have the Child Protection Services code applies to us=
?"</i><br><br>
Do you see where this is going?<br><br>
Now, he does bring up a point that people will invariably go down ... "what=
 about murder?" ... the answer is simple, murder is against natural law, th=
us everyone is EQUALLY liable, under natural law: thus equity prevails<br><=
br>

He does make some assumptions that I do believe are incorrect on his audio =
with respect to Hillary Clinton. First off, I have a feeling that she is go=
ing to be placed into office as Donald Trump is already starting to show th=
e alienation of the voters that will continue until the election, but that =
is really not the issue here nor any of my concern; just an observation. In=
 the audio, the guy speaking makes the claim that if Hillary was to be indi=
cted from the email fiasco she finds herself, she could just whip out <i>"w=
hat facts do you have "these laws" apply to me?"</i> and she would be absol=
ved of any duty or obligtion under title 18 and such.<br><br>

I am led to believe that this is an incorrect assumption as Hillary has tak=
en an oath of office in order to hold her position. The oath itself binds h=
er to the constitution and the laws of the united states and I am still of =
the opinion that even though Title 18 has never supposedly ever received "c=
ongressional approval", that title still stands as "legal" in the current s=
tate of affairs under Title 50 and Amendment XIV: <i>The Congress shall hav=
e power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this arti=
cle.</i><br><br>

Like he states in that audio, the oath is deadly ... but I digress.<br><br>

Just one of the ramifications of this one question and in keeping with <a h=
ref=3D"http://iamsomedude.com/art.html" target=3D"_blank">the ongoing quest=
</a> with regards to <i>"LEGAL is the undoing of God's Law"</i>: Abortion I=
S murder: naturally and in equity, thus LEGAL can not be NATURAL because Ab=
ortion is not murder, legally. If abortion is "legal", <i>"what facts do yo=
u have "these laws" apply to anyone?"</i>; this one quesion does appear to =
support the FACT that LEGAL is the undoing of God's Law.<br><br>
Here is another ramification: If one were to ask this of an officer during =
the "event" and the officer keeps going or even arrests, then the officer A=
ND ANYONE else assisting him has a DUTY to SHOW THE FACTS and any failure o=
f such AUTOMATICALLY kicks in an "exercise of benefit of contract without c=
ontract" of which EQUITY will remedy: QUASI-CONTRACT, and that remedy is US=
UFRUCT (exerise of the right to property that does not belong to you and ex=
perience the profit therefrom) and the officer and ALL WHO ASSIST are now U=
SUFRUCTUARY and since these actors FAILED to PROVIED A SECURITY, there is a=
utomatic breach of contract upon the failure to answer <i>"what facts do yo=
u have "these laws" apply to me?"</i> because now the TACIT ADMISSION is wh=
at?<br><br>
<i><b>There are no FACTS to support the (INSURANCE) CLAIM</b></i><br><br>
HOWEVER, the BENEFIT TO THE CLAIM has been EXERCISED, thus DEFAULT under th=
e CONTRACT FOR THE CLAIM: a USUFRUCT, resulting from a VIOLATION of ARTICLE=
 46 of the Lieber Code: <i><font color=3D"blue">Neither officers nor soldie=
rs are allowed to make use of their position or power in the hostile countr=
y for private gain, not even for commercial transactions otherwise legitima=
te. Offenses to the contrary committed by commissioned officers will be pun=
ished with cashiering or such other punishment as the nature of the offense=
 may require; if by soldiers, they shall be punished according to the natur=
e of the offense</font></i> THUS said officer and accomplices are now subje=
ct under ARTICLE 44 of the Lieber Code: <i><font color=3D"blue">All wanton =

of death, or such other severe punishment as may seem adequate for the grav=
ity of the offense ... A soldier, officer, or private, in the act of commit=
ting such violence, and disobeying a superior ordering him to abstain from =
it, may be lawfully killed on the spot by such superior</font></i> AND ARTI=

<ul style=3D"list-style-type:none">
<li><a href=3D"http://iamsomedude.com/De%20Facto%20Trustee.htm" target=3D"_=
blank">De Facto Trsutee Doctrine:</a></li>
<li><br>A person is a de facto trustee where the person (1) assumed the off=
ice of trustee under a color of right or title and (2) exercised the duties=
 of the office. A person assumes the position of trustee under color of rig=
ht or title where the person asserts =EE&nbsp;=A1uthority that was derived =
from an election or appointment, no matter how irregular the election or ap=
pointment might be.?A de facto trustee=E0=A7=AFod-faith actions are binding=
 on third persons. Because the purported successor trustee in Allen Trust a=
cted as trustee and assumed its office through an appointment it reasonably=
 believed to be effective, it was a de facto trustee and was entitled to co=
mpensation for its services.<br><br></li>
</ul>

When someone acts AS IF they were the STATE or presumes to be cloaked with =
the authority as such, the ACTOR takes on the duties of the STATE of which =
is what?<br><br>
<i><b>Administrator and Usufructuary to ENSURE public order and safety be I=
NSURED.</b></i><br><br>
The SURRENDER of the USUFRUCT (right to the FALSE PROFITS) and ASSIGNMENT o=
f the REVERSION (anything done in NAME is for the glory of the STATE) acts =
to INSURE public order and safety be ENSURED and now the PUBLIC DEBT OBLIGA=
TION under Amendment XIV is the reciprocation of the indemnification provid=
ed under 12 USC 95a (2) and the Rules of Usufruct and of which neither SHAL=
L NOT BE QUESTIONED. Failure to discharge those duties is AUTOMATIC BREACH =
OF TRUST and now the ACTOR stands SUBJECT to the ACTS OF CONGRESS as DE FAC=
TO TRUSTEE under the Article IV Section 3 Clause 2 jurisdiction: entitled t=
o the BENEFITS and subject to the LIABILITIES ... the NATURAL LAW defense m=
echanism for protection of the ENVIRONMENT (Public Trust).
<br><br><br><br>
In Summary: The Maxims Of Law:
<ul>
<li>The greatest enemies to peace are force and wrong</li>
<li>A right cannot arise from a wrong</li>
<li>No one ought to enrich himself at the expense of others</li>
<li>Suppression of fact, which should be disclosed, is the same in effect a=
s willful misrepresentation</li>
</ul>
thus if there is no answer to <i>"what facts do you have "these laws" apply=
 to me?"</i> then all there stands is force which means there is no right. =
Is this what you brought me in here to understand?<br><br>
Think of it this way: if one is brought before a judge or something like th=
at, then the intent is what? Someone intended to bring you into the matter,=
 thus there is no point arguing ths NAME issue as the FACT is NAME exists f=
or the purpose of monetizing the sin of the man.<br><br>
Why not just use this to your advantage and instead of arguing, just ask: <=
i>"what facts do you have "these laws" apply to me?"</i> ... and the truth =
shall set you free.
