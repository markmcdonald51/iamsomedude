<i>=93Jesus seems like a pretty good guy. I like him because he was an anar=
chist.=94 =96 Jeff Berwick at his wedding ceremony.</i><br><br>

Truer words were never spoken. This week the Christian world again celebrat=
es the birth of Jesus, the world=92s most famous anarchist. Yet, saying Jes=
us was an anarchist is enough to cause many a church lady to leap from the =
altar. Could it be so?<br><br>

When Jesus was born, the world was not so different than the western world =
today.  Rome was the New World Order of that era. Julius Caesar had crossed=
 the Rubicon decades earlier, and Augustus Caesar had been emperor/dictator=
 for almost 25 years. Rome had become a failing welfare state whose legions=
 relied on exacting tribute from citizens in exchange for benefits in the f=
orm of social services. Rome had gone from a free republic to an empire, wh=
ile starting down a long path of debasing its currency, the known world=92s=
 reserve currency. A once independent and self-reliant society had become s=
elf-indulgent, apathetic and subject to the will of the dictators, who call=
ed themselves =93Fathers=94 and the benefactors of the people.<br><br>

Rome did not conquer Israel, but was invited in to administer a dispute bet=
ween two brothers over who should be king. Rome was the world police force =
of the day, and by appealing to Rome, Israel fell under the tribute of the =
Pax Romana excise tax and mutual obligations in exchange for Rome keeping t=
he peace of a pending civil war.<br><br>

<i>=93The hand of the diligent shall bear rule, but the slothful shall be u=
nder tribute.=94 Proverbs 12:24</i><br><br>

Under Pharisee and Roman influence, Israel had become a vast welfare state =
with people looking to the government to take care of them, as in the days =
under Egyptian and Babylonian captivity. People were committing the sin of =
coveting thy neighbor=92s goods, while electing benefactors to provide for =
their needs under the Roman system of Corban. Long gone was the system of g=
overnment set up under Moses that depended entirely of free will offerings =
to support the needy, distributed by a system of charitable ministers that =
served the welfare needs of the society.<br><br>

Jesus came along to lead his followers out of this ungodly Roman system, pr=
eaching an alternative form of government. He spoke of a jurisdiction outsi=
de of the Roman state, based on the perfect law of freedom, outside the tyr=
anny of men who would rule over their brothers and neighbors. He unified th=
e early Christian church in a system of charity, hope and respect for the r=
ights of each other, requiring that each person love thy neighbor as thy se=
lf in a system of mutual, not governmental support.<br><br>

Jesus baptized people out of the welfare system established by the Romans a=
nd Pharisees and into the charitable system administered by the apostles. T=
he Roman citizen ID stone that was part of their Corban was replaced with a=
 white stone from the Jordan River laid upon the altar signifying the perso=
n=92s baptism into the free Church society.<br><br>

The ministers of the early church were to be servants of the people and adm=
inister the free will offerings of the community. They were required to tak=
e a vow of poverty to ensure they did not abuse their administrative privil=
eges or siphon off the collective treasury. They took vows of celibacy to e=
nsure they did not create heirs that could be entitled to the charitable co=
ntributions they ministered over.<br><br>

Jesus was showing a way to unentangle people from the captivity of the soci=
al contracts they had made with the state of Rome and Judea, and the tribut=
e and obligations they had become snared by. He proclaimed to call no man =
=93Father=94, as they called their Roman benefactors, but stated that =93th=
ou Father art in heaven=94. The perfect law of freedom indicated that man=
=92s unalienable rights stemmed from God and nature, and not governments of=
 men. This was a system of anarchy, by strict definition, without the compl=
ex system of tribute that led to the decadence and decline of society, and =
the corruptible force of the state to back it up.<br><br>

The early Christian church was not persecuted for their belief in a differe=
nt God or a Kingdom in Heaven, but for their opting out of the mutual taxat=
ion system and seeking to live apart from the kings and overlords, the gods=
 many, who demanded their tribute. Governments have no inalienable rights t=
o rule over men. They obtain lawful authority through the consent of the go=
verned. Understanding how that consent is obtained and granted is the key t=
o understanding liberty and your own political status. Anarchy is merely th=
at lack of imposed government, and the seeking of your own independent juri=
sdiction. According to Brother Gregory Williams, the term =93Republic=94 ac=
tually stems from the pre-Caesar words =93Libera Res Publica=94 (Free from =
things Public, i.e. heavy government). Starting with Augustus, they dropped=
 the =93Free=94 part. (<a href=3D"http://www.newswithviews.com/Gregory/will=
iams117.htm" target=3D"_blank">http://www.newswithviews.com/Gregory/william=
s117.htm</a>)<br><br>

Having created his government-less society, Jesus  took on the Pharisees, e=
ssentially a political party at the time, who had passed an ordinance requi=
ring the temple tax be paid or face the judgment of a civil magistrate of t=
he Judean government. These taxes flowed into the government=92s treasury w=
ithin the temple whether it served the people or not. The central treasury =
that held the government funds could be abused by a greedy population or a =
corrupt bureaucracy.<br><br>

The moneychangers required the temple tax to be paid in the denarii, and to=
ok their commissioned cut of the currency conversion for the people to wors=
hip. When Jesus overturned the tables of the moneychangers, he was really t=
hreatening the powerful elite=92s ungodly way of life. This final insult co=
uld no longer be tolerated.<br><br>

When brought before Pilate, Jesus declared, =93My Kingdom is not of this wo=
rld=94. The word =93world=94 was written kosmos in the original Greek, whic=
h is defined as =93orderly arrangement=94, =93order=94 or =93government=94.=
 What Jesus was really saying was that his Kingdom on this earth was not a =
part of the government of Rome, and explicitly not within their jurisdictio=
n to rule over him. And Pilate generally agreed that he had no jurisdiction=
 over Jesus=92 Kingdom of non-government. Jesus had taken the Kingdom from =
those who would suppress and subject the people in sloth and servitude, and=
 entrusted it to His loyal followers who were leaders in a Kingdom that set=
 men free in spirit and in truth. Anarchy indeed.<br><br>

The Pharisees appealed to Rome to get rid of Jesus, but Jesus would not app=
eal to Rome for protection. Had He appealed to Rome, he would have compromi=
sed the sovereignty of His Kingdom on earth.<br><br>

Today, most of us find ourselves under slothful tribute to an emperor and a=
 system that is not for our benefit. We have coveted our neighbor=92s goods=
 in a vain pursuit of =93free=94 health care, education, welfare, unemploym=
ent benefits, social security and government protection. We have traded our=
 inalienable God-given rights through social contracts both implied and exp=
licit. Our churches are not ordained by God, but are 501(c)(3) corporations=
 granted status by the state. As we head into this Christmas week, and into=
 what is certainly going to be a volatile 2012, we are going to need to dig=
 down deep and find that anarchist in all of us, with a little more loving =
thy neighbor as thy self to boot.<br><br>

Happy Holidays!<br><br>
