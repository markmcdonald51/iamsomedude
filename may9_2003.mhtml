<b>Summary Judgment  (necessity)</b><br><br>

**	Good morning!  We=92ve got some information back from a tort claim that =
I=92d like to run by you.   From what I understand is that he went to court=
 and did the Surety Bond and Show Cause why a Tort Claim should not issue. =
   Let me read what he got from the OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE O=
F INDIANA.<br><br>  It reads:  This letter is to inform you that we receive=
d the Tort Claim you submitted.  We will be collecting information and docu=
mentation necessary to make a determination with respect to your claim.  If=
 you have additional material you feel should be considered in our review, =
please mail it to our attention and mention the File Number noted above.<br=
><br>
   Pursuant to Indiana Code 34-13-3-11, we will notify you in writing, with=
in 90 days, if the State approves your claim.  A claim is deemed denied if =
not approved in its entirety within 90 days, unless the parties have reache=
d a settlement before the expiration of that period.  If your claim is deni=
ed, you have two years from the date of loss in which to file a lawsuit to =
have your claim heard in court.  If your claim is approved, we will mail yo=
u a check for the agreed-upon settlement amount.<br><br>
   If you have any questions in the interim, please refer to OUR FILE NUMBE=
R in your letter. <br><br>=20
Then it was ended without a signature but said:  Sincerely, Office of the A=
ttorney General, Tort Claim Investigations.<br><br>
    Where I see they try to have a loop hole in there when they say it has =
to be approved in its =91entirety=92.  <br><br>
R:	Well that=92s okay.  Because you see if we get the denial, okay that=92s=
 the negative so then at that point whoever signs that denial we can go and=
 pay the filing fee and commence action against them in a state court.  <br=
><br>
**	Okay, because I=92m wondering if he sent this in to the federal.  I=92m =
pretty sure I gave him the address but he isn=92t sure he mailed it in or j=
ust filed it with the court papers.  <br><br>
R:	What I=92m saying is when we get the denial, the denial is the order for=
 the warrant.  At that point we commence action and we order whoever signed=
 the denial appear with a subpoena duces tecum (Lat. Bring with you)  The n=
ame of certain species of writs, of which the subpoena duces tecum is the m=
ost usual, requiring a party who is summoned to appear in court to bring wi=
th him some document, piece of evidence, or other thing to be used or inspe=
cted by the court.) at the court.  The duces tecum means with the check.   =
See we can notice these judges because what we=92re going to do now is we=
=92re going to start suing every Municipality that these courts have passed=
 through.  I think the way these things are being set up around these Metro=
 areas.  All these Metro areas are surrounded by all of these municipalitie=
s.<br><br>
**	Right I=92m noticing all the police cars have now got this big square an=
d an M in the middle for metro.   Use to say, =93To protect and to serve=94=
.<br><br> =20
R:	Well you see what we=92re going to do is we=92re going to sue each munic=
ipality that has anything=85  See tell everyone to keep their envelopes so =
we can see where the bill of exchange is passed through.  Okay?  And you se=
e we=92re going to accuse the corporations of the misconduct see in allowin=
g these hoodlums to use their facilities.  We=92re going to sue them as a p=
erson.<br><br>
**	Terrific!  Sue the municipality.<br><br>
R:	Because they have allowed the commercial instrument to pass through them=
.  They are now a sexual predator.  See the passing through of that changes=
 the gender of the commercial instrument and thereby libels them for the ex=
change.   Then you see they go from one to another to try to escape the pap=
er trail and try to make the paper trail so cumbersome so we=92re not follo=
wing them by paper any more we=92re following them electronically.<br><br> =
=20
**	So us keeping the envelopes and that will tell us=85<br><br>
R:	Shows the evidence that that municipality is liable.  Then you see you l=
iable them with an affidavit.  <br><br>
**	Oh the affidavit in truth, sworn under oath to be true, correct and comp=
lete.  <br><br>
R:	Right=85 so when we sue them we actually go pay the filing fee with your=
 cash money or whatever and when you do that you also list that as one of t=
heir liabilities in the action itself.  Earmark the filing fee and sue them=
 directly for it.  So when they appear at the court they=92re going to have=
 to have a check for that. <br><br>=20
**	So you=92d be suing Los Angeles Municipalities as a person.  Okay.<br><b=
r>
R:	Let=92s say you=92re living in some other fringe suburb, you see, which =
is also a municipality of it=92s own, you sue them too.   Everything that p=
asses through!  You have an envelope=85.see the city of Los Angeles is resp=
onsible in some manner because of the zip codes are under Los Angeles=85 we=
ll no maybe not.   Anyway what I=92m saying is postal and then again it doe=
sn=92t have to be a postal seal either because if that=85 lets say the pros=
ecutor resides in another municipality other then where the court action is=
 filed.  You list that municipality too=85because he lives there.  <br><br>
**	We=92re basically doing this based on them failing to prevent this from =
happening?<br><br>
R:	Yes!  So what they are, is they have become the instigators and they=92v=
e become a sexual predator for the purpose of reaping the benefits of victi=
ms of dismissed conduct.   You see if we sue them what they=92ve got to do =
is they=92ve got to set aside the amount of the law suit in reserves.  So t=
hat means that they have to answer to the federal reserve for that amount o=
f money right there on the spot.  And what we=92ll do is we=92ll just serve=
 some official from the municipality---maybe the Mayor.  We don=92t have to=
 hunt down the risk management.  We=92ll just subpoena him duces tecum to s=
how up at the court with that documentation or better yet with the check.  =
 Because you see when they issue this denial, the denial is an order of the=
 court=85<br><br>
**	Okay!<br><br>
R:	It=92s the warrant that=92s looking for the order so that=92s why we=92l=
l take that denial if we have to and deposit it in the bank and then we=92l=
l summon the banker to appear duces tecum with the warrant that corresponds=
 with that order.=97and that=92s the check.<br><br>
**	Well that doesn=92t seem too complicated.  <br><br>
R:	Yeah!  You see if we deposit it and summon the banker or we can commence=
 action against the municipality and order the Mayor to show up duces tecum=
.  In other words he=92s got to appear at the court with his body and the d=
ocument that=92s requested.   The document is the warrant that corresponds =
with that order.  <br><br>
**	It=92s back to the order looking for the warrant.  Makes sense.   I have=
n=92t got the envelopes quite clear but I think the court process sounds ri=
ght.<br><br>
R:	The envelope contains a bill of exchange.  They=92re identifying the mun=
icipality under which its being charged the exchange.<br><br>
**	So it=92s the address or the post mark?<br><br>
R:	The post mark.
**	Ohhh=85 the meter that cancels the stamp.<br><br>
R:	They identify the municipality that they are charging the postage to. <b=
r><br>=20
**	I=92ll have to start looking at them again.   Sometimes the ink gets so =
faint or it=92s over the stamp and you can=92t really read it.<br><br>
R:	Those are meters.  So what you want to do is throw it into a mail box ag=
ain and let the post office send it again.  See that=92s what we use to do =
with some of these lawyers that were trying to set us up with a court date =
that=92s already gone by.   What they would do=85 sometimes they would even=
 put zero zero postage on it.    Whenever we=92d get these though we=92d ju=
st go sling them into a mail box and then the post master would cancel thos=
e.  <br><br>
**	They are so corrupt.  County Council use to do that to me and when I=92d=
 complain to the court administrator they would all act like I was the one =
that made the mistakes.  I even took the envelopes in there and they tried =
to blame it on the post office.   Just thinking of those corrupt tyrants st=
ill makes me angry and that=92s when those bastards get the edge because no=
thing is at stake for them.<br><br>
R:	Yeah!  Yeah!  We use to have to throw the mailings from the attorney=92s=
 or courts back into a regular mailbox  quite often.<br><br>
**	You think that this court action is going to solve things or be more ben=
eficial then the involuntary bankruptcy?<br><br>
R:	I don=92t know.  The bankruptcy to make it effective you got so darn muc=
h stuff to do I think I=92d go this route first.   See because I=92ve got s=
ome bankruptcies that are filed and look pretty good but it=92s too much wo=
rk.<br><br>
**	Oh poop!  I was hoping that they would be a little easier then to go thr=
ough all these different motions and stuff=85 UGH!<br><br>
R:	No see what you do is you bring a complaint against them.  You bring the=
 complaint and you issue the Summary Judgment and hook it right in with the=
 complaint and it all goes in with an affidavit and we just simply let them=
 know then that they=92re sued and they are required to provide this remedy=
 and in the event they employ a judge to issue the denial or refusal or dis=
missal, okay then we take that dismissal then and call for a hearing becaus=
e they=92re in default.  <br><br>
**	Usually the response to that is always a demur if it=92s state or a 12B6=
 if it=92s federal.<br><br>
R:	Yeah well okay that=92s the admission to the order.  Now it=92s a subpoe=
na duces tecum to appear at the court or show cause why they shouldn=92t be=
 held in contempt.  <br><br>
**	Oh=85 okay.  I might have to something like that for this guy on doing a=
 motion to dismiss when they don=92t have a claim in fact=85 an empty claim=
 and enclose a Surety Bond with it.  That=92s kind of some strategy I was t=
hinking.<br><br>
R:	Well you see we get to where we actually pay the filing fee in the state=
 court.  But you=92ve got to account for the filing fee in the complaint.<b=
r><br>
**	Okay like on E* because she never did pay the filing fee except with her=
 private account check.  You think she should start a new action and pay th=
e filing fee?<br><br>
R:	Sure!  But then list that fee as one of the damages in the actual compla=
int.  Put that in specifically as one of the separate items that adds up to=
 the sum total, because the sum total is the summary judgment=85.  That=92s=
  Sum Mary!   (Chuckling)<br><br>
**	Oh I was going to say, =93That=92s some Total=94.  (Chuckling)  E* did a=
 little letter to this Loanstar Mortgage.   You know how they fragmented ev=
erything and have about 4 or 5 different lenders.  Well she wrote and told =
them her records indicate no debt owing, however if they are claiming a deb=
t provide the assessment.  Then she pretty much sent them the information r=
egarding all the stuff from Wells Fargo showing payment in full and telling=
 this company who is another part of Wells Fargo, I think it is 1st America=
n Title Co.  Anyway she is authorizing them to go ahead and pay the claim.<=
br><br>
R:	Now if she names the municipality and in the complaint, and you can serv=
e those papers on any officer in the municipality and you see I think we ne=
ed to nail a couple of the municipalities that surround the metro but also =
name the metro.  Because what it does is it ties up a certain amount of the=
ir funding.  They have to set it aside regardless of what happens.  If ther=
e is potential liability out there and until they settle it they have to se=
t it aside as a reserve=85. And that=92s the Federal Reserve!  That=92s our=
 accounts. <br><br>=20
**	Wow!  I didn=92t realize they had to set funds aside.<br><br>
R:	Yeah they do.  <br><br>
**	So if they get a lot of law suits that=92s going to put a stress on the =
funds.<br><br>
R:	Yep!  Yep! Yep!  They can=92t pass through all this bs money--- they hav=
e to answer to the principals.  But you see the problem that we=92ll have i=
s then to force these people into a position to where they have to pay up a=
nd you see once we=92ve got them where they=92ve done the denial=85<br><br>
**	Yeah=85<br><br>
R:	That=92s the order for the warrant!  That=92s a money order!  That=92s a=
 court order!  Now we take the court order and we enter that into court and=
 we notify either the banker or probably the Mayor of the City to appear su=
bpoena duces tecum with the warrant.  =96 the corresponding warrant that co=
rresponds with this municipality because those are mutual funds.  Mutual fu=
nds means that we have a mutual agreement Buddy and that=92s what the Bill =
of Exchange is all about.  <br><br>
**	Getting it!<br><br>
R:	Okay!  So you see you=92re going to have to have the filing fees paid to=
 get the state jurisdiction involved to where now we have the order for the=
 warrant but we want them to issue their warrant.  Which means---it=92s a c=
heck!  A check is a warrant.  Because the state is defacto and so now we wa=
nt the defacto warrant. <br><br>=20
**	Isn=92t that putting us in the position that we=92re recognizing or defe=
ating HJR-192?... and we=92re taking it back and forth at our convenience?<=
br><br>
R:	Yeah!  Right!  I=92ve always said that we own both sides of that account=
.<br><br>
**	Right!  That=92s true.<br><br>
R:	The thing is, whoever is the holder-in-due course, we want the instrumen=
ts to be placed in the bank.  That is still one of our employees.  We don=
=92t handle the money they do.<br><br>
**	That=92s right we have fiduciary debtor and fiduciary creditor on our be=
half so we are insulated from the charges.<br><br>
R:	That=92s what we want.  We want the check that can be deposited in my ac=
count so my banker can pay my bills now when I send them in or when I send =
a check in.  Because people have gotten themselves to the idea, =93Well I=
=92ve created the money and I=92m handling the money and I=92m this and I=
=92m that.=94   Nope that=92s what kills ya!  It=92s all your employees tha=
t are doing that. <br><br>=20
**	Right!  Okay.<br><br>
R:	As a matter of fact there is no difference between a debit and a credit =
because the definition of a proton is simple the absence of the electron.  =
 So you see the proton is a mental idea or arbitrary atomic weight that has=
 to be agreed because it=92s weightless in the state and until the fall of =
man, until man falls to the earth cause he=92s subject to gravity they can=
=92t identify it there.  But see that=92s what they=92re doing.  When that =
judge issues that electron, we=92re stating, =93Bring the proton to the cou=
rt that corresponds with this electron because you guys are working in the =
inner office.=94  =85 that=92s insider trading.  <br><br>
**	Wow!  That sort of clears up the path=85  I was really hoping to stay ou=
t of court but I think with the way you just described that it seems like i=
t isn=92t going to go into a big bunch of circles and arguments. <br><br>=
=20
R:	Yes just do that summary judgment and attach it right to the back of the=
 complaint and then put it in with an affidavit.  Now you see they can=92t =
escape that unless they have another affidavit that has to deal with the ac=
tual liability.<br><br>
**	So it would just be the complaint, summary judgment and the affidavit?<b=
r><br>
R:	The complaint goes through and puts the prayer for relief in and bla bla=
 blah for damages and then the rest of the papers can be the notice for the=
 move for summary judgment.   You can move for Summary Judgment on any case=
 at any time.   You=92re just summing up everything as the facts are right =
here and now and now you=92re putting an affidavit in stating this is where=
 the facts are.<br><br>
**	Hopefully it will be a one time or two at the most slam dunk?!<br><br>
R:	Oh yeah!  See now the only way that they can get rid of the judgment is =
to oppose it with an affidavit of their own.  The affidavit of their own is=
 going to have to deal with the liability.  They can=92t deal with irreleva=
nt facts and just call it simply an affidavit and we fulfilled a procedure.=
  Cause you could state that right in your complaint that any opposition to=
 the summary judgment rendered and what=92s sworn to by affidavit=85<br><br=
>
**	They have to make sure it is true, correct, and complete and most of the=
 attorney=92s don=92t have first hand knowledge. <br><br>
R:	Right and what you can do in the complaint is simply state that the oppo=
sing affidavit must deal with the liability and secondary evidence is only =
admission to the liability and will be held by this court as a contempt.   =
If the opposition fails to address the issue in fact!  But you see the issu=
e in fact, the only way they can address it is to provide the court with a =
settlement=97and you spell out what the settlement is or show cause why the=
 Mayor of XYZ City should not appear duces tecum with the warrant correspon=
ding to the order.  <br><br>
**	Like this little letter with the tort information.  It says:  You have 2=
 years to sue if your tort claim is denied to have a hearing in a court=85 =
<br><br>
R:	Okay well he can do that immediately.  <br><br>
**	He=92s scheduled to go to court in August so they=92re waiting to see wh=
at goes with the tort claim=85 that would be 90 days so they=92re already t=
hinking it=92s going to be denied.<br><br>
R:	Well you see anything less then immediate settlement you see is still a =
refusal and that is the element that he could move on right now.  Any delay=
 of the 90 days is the negative order that we now move for the subpoena duc=
es tecum just pick the party which could be a municipal mayor or officer.  =
The Mayor or his agent is going to have to appear.  An authorized agent of =
the municipality.   That Mayor doesn=92t want to leave his daily affairs ju=
st to go down to one of these but if his name is on this subpoena, he=92d l=
ike to appoint someone, but if his name is on that subpoena personally and =
he=92s to personally appear with the document they=92re going to offer sett=
lement before that.<br><br>
**	Have you heard anything from R* the lady with the herbs for pets?<br><br=
>
R:	I talked to her several days ago.<br><br>
**	Oh no she went to court and I usually hear from her when she goes to cou=
rt or something happens and I haven=92t heard.   I have a feeling that they=
 nabbed her.<br><br>
R:	Ohhh!  You think so?<br><br>
**	They were moving on her pretty aggressive and had publicized some pretty=
 rough news on tv and newspapers about her.<br><br>
R:	She was going to contact you she said.<br><br>
**	Yes I did send her some stuff but I don=92t know whether she was able to=
 do much with it if her hearing was the following morning.  I=92ll just hav=
e to hold off but this what you=92re telling me now is going to be very hel=
pful.<br><br>
R:	Well the next time she appears we=92ll be able to give her better organi=
zed stuff.  The guys in Canada are putting together a war chest and they=92=
re going after some of these officials and I think this one guy=92s mother =
is putting together some documents that they won=92t be able to escape his =
mother.<br><br> =20
**	Somebody put together this paper and I think they did a really good job.=
  I don=92t know who did it but in reading it I think it is pretty much in =
line with your concepts.   Now this guy that got the letter regarding the t=
ort apparently thought he was facing about 4 years in prison and he said a =
friend did it and his wife faxed it to the jail.  It did reduce the bail fr=
om $10,000 to $1,000 and his trial is still going on schedule.    (THIS IS =
ATTACHED OR TITLED =91ANONYMOUS=92 )<br><br>
R:	Yeah that sounds good.   If you want to share it by sending it to J*C*. =
 See we just got another guy out and his wife called and asked if it was ok=
ay that he wears the bracelet.  I said, =93Sure=94  See we=92re going to st=
art binding them to the agreements.  Anything that can get them out to what=
 he agrees to.   So he agrees to take the bracelet, well then they didn=92t=
 put any of these other conditions on him, he just stays within these geogr=
aphical areas of what that bracelet allows.  Okay=85 what we=92re going to =
do then is we=92re going to move against the cities and the metros and do i=
t this way.  Commence the action, pay the fees, list the fees in the compla=
int that they have to pay up so that we can get the state then to give us a=
 compelling duces tecum to make the banker appear at the court with the cor=
responding warrant in exchange for that bracelet.  That=92ll be the value.<=
br><br>
**	Yeah they=92re holding him for a value.  <br><br>
R:	Right!  That=92s what we=92ll do.  We=92ll exchange it for the bracelet.=
  So that=92s why I told him to just go ahead and get out and you=92ll have=
 time to prepare this stuff.  That=92s really the basis for that decision. =
  The bracelet is golden.  Why?  Because it=92s based on paper gold or IMF.=
<br><br>
**	Oh the paper contract gold=85 pure gold.<br><br>
R:	That=92s the only way you can get pure gold, the other is fine gold=85. =
  And that=92s where the fines come from.<br><br>
**	I love that.  It makes so much sense.   I talked to someone else last ni=
ght and we=92re all going to start calling the Homeland Security and start =
getting these people to start answering us.  First we have to get everythin=
g resolved with E* house.  That would be a shame if anyone looses their hou=
ses when we=92ve worked at this so much.  <br><br>
R:	Well I think she can do what we just talked about.   She can list the mu=
nicipalities and make them liable joint and several.  <br><br>
**	You know around here in this big ole metropolis it is harder to find wha=
t area the judge lives in.  They are so protected.<br><br>
R:	That=92s okay, than just list that one municipality.  But what I=92m say=
ing is that some of these judges will travel from one jurisdiction to anoth=
er.<br><br>=09
**	Oh I know they do in the federal but I=92m not sure with the state.<br><=
br>
R:	You nail them because the commercial instrument has passed through and t=
hey have allowed these hoodlums to pass and when they do that they have bec=
ome a sexual predator.  These hoodlums that are passing are carrying contra=
band and the state has failed to stop them at the border.   See what we=92r=
e doing, is we=92re going to order them to appear subpoena duces tecum.  Ap=
pear at court with their authorization or with the warrant=85 the warrant t=
hat corresponds with the order.  <br><br>
**	Now if you do that as the summary judgment that would be part of them to=
 appear if they don=92t settle, right?<br><br>
R:	In the event they fail to volunteer it.   In the event they fail to make=
 settlement.---immediately.  Then you see the moving party will make a date=
 for them to appear because you=92ll go in and you apply for a subpoena duc=
es tecum you=92ll have it all prepared and the clerk stamps them.  Bang!...=
 they=92re in.  But you see those will be accompanied with affidavits.  <br=
><br>
**	Right and they=92d have to dispute the affidavits.<br><br>
R:	Right=85 Yes and see they=92re going to have to appear with the instrume=
nt under which the subpoena requires.  In other words they are to show up w=
ith the warrant.   The corresponding warrant that corresponds with the cour=
t order or the order or the request or claim, from the employee or who has =
traveled through the municipality.  In other words, we=92ll summon the Mayo=
r.    Tell him why.  Tell him you and your corporation engaged in predatory=
 practices and stalking.  They=92re trading stock in the stock market.  Why=
?  Because they=92re trading in mutual funds.<br><br> =20
**	Mutual funds=85 municipality.  Makes sense.<br><br>
R:	So that=92s how E* can hit them between the eyes.  She=92s got an action=
 open right now?<br><br>
**	Well they=92ve already ruled on it and of course they ruled it a default=
 because they never acknowledged her being there because of the private che=
ck.    So what they=92ve done is they=92ve reinstated the note.   However t=
hey are trying to also collect legal fees.  What I think is going to be int=
eresting is all the paperwork in their records has been accepted by her and=
 they don=92t have any new signatures unless they attach that judges decisi=
on order to the documents<br><br>
R:	Okay well that=92s why she has to now tell them that she=92s bringing th=
e action by the subpoena.  They=92re going to have to appear with the corre=
sponding warrant because that=92s what=92s missing and that=92s what they=
=92re telling her.<br><br> =20
**	She could be the one now starting a new action and be the plaintive.<br>=
<br>
R:	Yes!  She can pay the filing fee.   Just commence the action but make su=
re you put the filing fee as one of the damages because you haven=92t got a=
ny better evidence then the Clerk of Court giving you a receipt for that fi=
ling fee.  <br><br>
**	Right!  Okay.   And just add that in to all of that other stuff.  <br><b=
r>
R:	Yes!  Make sure that it=92s there and that that person is going to be re=
sponsible because the clerk can actually be called as a witness during the =
court proceedings if they really want to get cute.   If you run into someth=
ing unexpected in there and they start to roll over you then just call the =
clerk to bring into evidence the liability of the filing fee.  <br><br>
**	Well then what they=92ll be doing is basically hanging the judge.<br><br=
>
R:	Right! And the judge isn=92t going to allow that to go.  He=92ll have to=
 order the clerk of court to write the check then if there isn=92t anybody =
else available.  I=92ve had that happen to me.   When I had a bonded action=
 one time I had going I had to pay my bail bond but I prevailed in the case=
 but before I left, you see, even before we finished that day, I said, =93N=
ow I=92ve complied with the bond requirements on appearance so I want the o=
rder and the record for the clerk to return my surety bond.=94  They made t=
hat note and 3 or 4 days after I got home I had the check in the mail and i=
t was drawn on that court and signed by the Clerk of Court.  <br><br>
**	Wow!  You know on that little letter that I just read you that I=92m goi=
ng to be sharing?...
How should that be signed or do you think it needs a signature?<br><br>
R:	Like we always do it=85<br><br>
**	Well it=92s kind of from someone like a second witness or an outsider.  =
How about anonymous?<br><br>
R:	You might do that or if it=92s a husband or wife they can be the authori=
zed representative.  They have a marriage contract.   Oh yeah you bet a hus=
band and wife can act on power of attorney, attorney in fact any of it and =
the courts recognize it.  <br><br>
**	Good.  Okay.  Then I think maybe some samples of how to write up court p=
apers.  That=92s usually another big block we all have because of the court=
=92s way of procedures.<br><br>
R:	Well you know it=92s very simple.  I think you can get the forms even ou=
t of the books, like you=92ve got a jurisdiction statement, or you=92ve got=
 to show the parties the jurisdiction statement and a statement of the fact=
s.  I think there is a format that those courts probably post.  <br><br>
**	They use to but now with the internet maybe some of that stuff can be fo=
und on line it=92s just what all papers are required for the courts to acce=
pt the papers.   I know you know B*T* and he knows procedure and he takes e=
verything out of title 28 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedures and he sets =
the court up as his court.  He has like 5 things you have to watch for or d=
o.  I can=92t remember now all the stuff but I=92ll be putting some of that=
 on my web page.  <br><br>
R:	Okay!  Well I know that California courts, they=92ve got the forms right=
 in the book at the end of each chapter.  <br><br>
**	Yeah I think you=92re right.  I know we use to get them out of the law l=
ibrary and pretty much use the formats and then of course add what we wante=
d to.  Many times they give you the court sites of why you file that partic=
ular pleading.  UGH!  I think there are also Matthew Bender books on proced=
ure.<br><br>
R:	Well I=92m talking about the state courts.  They have books that you can=
 just fill in the forms or get the language right out of the books.  They a=
re the local rules of court for your area.<br><br>
**	Yeah well those little books cost somewhere in the neighborhood of about=
 80 or 90 bucks, for their private corporation to sock it to you and you ha=
ve to learn how to use their weapons!  GROAN!<br><br>
R:	Well I think you can set up an account with them and then send them a pr=
ivate check.  I=92ve done that before.   Those books though would have the =
forms for about every use that you would need they would have that in it.<b=
r><br>
**	I=92ll check with a couple of friends and see what we can come up with.<=
br><br>
R:	See I think some of those legal bookstores are hooked up with West Publi=
shing.  Okay now West Publishing goes under another name called West Group =
now.<br><br>
**	Okay.  I=92ll see what I can come up with.   This is a good heads up for=
 what we may have to end up doing.  I know I use to think that you just sub=
mit this information to the court and the bank or whoever would have to ans=
wer you but it ends up the bank and the judge are both on the same side.  I=
 went to court so much when I was fighting to keep my house.  It becomes so=
 long and drug out and it=92s almost like playing chess or some strategy ga=
me but they have the edge and they don=92t give you a handicap.<br><br>
R:	Well this should back them up and bring it to conclusion fairly fast.   =
They=92re going to have to bring the warrant for the order.  If they have t=
he information in their possession that is required for the order tell them=
, =93 you either hand it over to me or you are going to appear with me.  An=
d if you fail to appear with me then I=92m going to ask the judge for an ar=
rest warrant=85for you!=94  That=92s what the subpoena duces tecum does.<br=
><br> =20
**	Right.  If we=92ve accepted it then it belongs to us.  We=92re the debto=
r in possession and he=92s the delinquent creditor.<br><br>
R:	Now you need to go in and tell them the fellow that has the information =
that you requested has refused to appear and I want a warrant to issue for =
his arrest.  Because the warrant then is yours.  The judge is going to hold=
 it for you but the warrant means that as soon as he=92s in custody you get=
 the proceeds.  <br><br>
**	So for example the warrant would come from the banker=85.<br><br>
R:	Yep!... the bank of first deposit.  That=92s the bank where they deposit=
ed the check.<br><br>
**	Right the merchant or whoever you gave the check to.<br><br>
R:	Right.  It can=92t come from the private account because they never beco=
me involved.  That=92s covered by the privacy act.  Nobody=92s business.  I=
t only accesses electronically and it=92s none of their business what happe=
ns on the other end of that electronic.   The thing is the bank of first de=
posit is the one that=92s accountable and somebody in that organization is =
going to appear with the duces tecum with the document or they=92re going t=
o be arrested so the court can issue the warrant.  They=92re going to issue=
 the warrant which means they=92ll give you the check=85   Place it in your=
 bank and now the bank will be holding them as their prisoners so that you =
can go ahead and pay your bills. <br><br>
**	All right!  I=92ll internalize this and see where it takes me.<br><br>
R:	Okay!  Here is the other thing that you can include in your statement is=
 that the bank or under that subpoena duces tecum=85  that person who is to=
 bring that information is to identify the ghost account that matches the o=
utstanding claim that=92s the cause of the action.  He=92s going to have to=
 identify the ghost account or bring that information forward.<br><br>
**	Wow that=92s really helpful.  That ghost account is going to be very rev=
ealing.  That would have to be from the one that didn=92t charge the claim.=
<br><br>
R:	Yes!<br><br>
**	Okay=85  Thank you!  Thank you! =20
