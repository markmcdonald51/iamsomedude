My response: and in accordance with military and martial law (admiralty):=

<i>A person is said to be a usufructuary or to enjoy a usufruct in property=
 in which he has an interest of a special kind for life or some lesser peri=
od. The rules of usufruct require that the property be used in such a manne=
r that its corpus is not impaired. The occupant has no right of appropriati=
ng immovable property of the enemy state as booty. He has a duty of managin=
g such property and is entitled to the profits arising there from. He canno=
t sell or alienate such property since this would be exercising sovereignty=
 over the occupied territory. He may lease or utilize lands or buildings fo=
r the period of occupation, i.e., he may lease the operation of public rail=
roads, agricultural lands and forests and other public property and receive=
 the profit from their operation. - Law of Belligerent Occupation</i>
<br><br>

<i>An occupant administering real estate may simply safe guard the capital =
by preventing creditors from attaching the property =96 Law of Belligerent =
Occupation</i>
<br><br>

Once the money supply became tied to the people as surety for the value (re=
payment), the people hold a right of equitable subrogation against ANY CLAI=
M made against them, for they never receive value in exchange as considerat=
ion for the supply of their energy. It matters not if they now switch over =
to gold or asset back (see BRICS) as money is now just a means by which nat=
ions settle their debts amongst each other, the people are STILL the backin=
g (account receivables: taxpayers) as "collateral" to secure "loans and oth=
er monetary drawing rights" because money will always be debt so long as it=
 is issued by PRIVATE BANKERS and make no mistake BRICS is PRIVATE ISSUE.<b=

This is why Lincoln and Hitler were so successful with their respective mon=
etary policies. All you need to do is look at the <a href=3D"http://iamsome=
dude.com/pdf/carey_currency_letter.pdf" target=3D"_blank">Carey Currency Le=
tter</a> and see what had been done. Each of these dudes pulled their respe=
ctive countries out of debt in a very short period of time: nationalizing t=
he monetary policy. <br><br>




No private issues. <br><br>




No "debt as money" loaned into existence. <br><br>




<a href=3D"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D8vfdZtpx_ug&amp;feature=3Dyout=
u.be" target=3D"_blank">In Germany, Hitler learned these lessons and money =
existed as a matter of national policy.</a><br><br>







If people would actually get down to the bare bones, the people would see i=
t is their own ignorance of how this energy flows that is causing their cur=
rent state of affairs. The only way out is to pull their head from their as=
s and take responsibly for the fruit they produce from their dominion of th=
e earth.<br><br>




The people, in refusing to accept this responsibly, have abandoned their di=
vine dreams in exchange for the hollowed out trappings of this world and ha=
ve granted others who know about this usufructuary nature of money their po=
wer to dictate what dream the people shall partake. <br><br>

No matter what monetary policy is followed, eventually the treasury will re=
ceive the fruit of the people and the government then exists to govern thos=
e who refuse or can't govern themselves with that fruit and right now the f=
ruit of the people has been geared to war and destruction so the people rec=
eive the fruits of their own efforts in fulfillment of these dreams they to=
ok up with the abandonment of their divine dreams.<br><br>





There is no escape from this and either people can concentrate on the suppo=
sed wrongs committed by those supposedly in charge or the people can remove=
 their head from their ass and begin to take some fucking responsibility fo=
r the state of affairs of this world and stop blaming everyone and everythi=
ng else.<br><br>




At least that way, they have something with which they can work.<br><br>





And all one need to do is consult the BIBLE (public trust administration ma=
nual) and one sees the way to the "New World" is to place all tithing (usuf=
ruct + reversion) into the storehouse (treasury) pursuant to Malachi 3:10 a=
nd then challenge "God" (State) for fulfillment of the covenant (fulfillmen=
t of the Old World (old testament) in exchange for the New World (new testa=
ment)) for one demonstrates one is faithful in death (probate is an adminis=
trative function for "clearing house" purposes) by rendering unto Caesar th=
at which is Caesar's so Caesar is now bound by covenant to render unto God'=
s that which is God's in order one be granted the crown of life (leave one =
way of life in exchange for the adoption of another) and adopted as a son o=
f God (one who possesses and expresses their divine dream) and ambassador o=
f the Christ Consciousness (the light within not ruled by ego: heart as gov=
erning light of man) as Lucifer/Satan is cast out (ego as governing light o=
f man).<br><br>



This is all reflected within the Secular Law (international law) through th=
e Law of Nations, Lieber Code, Hague, Vienna, Geneva, Trading with the enem=
y Acts (12 USC 95a (2)), treaties (1814 Ghent and 1783 Paris), ICCPR and th=
e like in order man's law and God's law be consolidated and the current "ha=
ndlers" maintain their position with and in honor: servant to God and his i=
nterests and rulers over those who reject the divine gifts and their intere=
sts for all governments are ordained by God or they would not exist. <br><b=
r>

The people have just been advertly enticed into their current state of affa=
irs and the human captial referred to is in regards to "employees" of which=
 the NAME to whom the SSN was established and the one of whom is claiming t=
o be stands for the inclusion of one is the exlsuion of another and those c=
onsenting and those pertpetrating are to be embraced in the same punishment=
s.<br><br>

So, whose fault is all of this really?
