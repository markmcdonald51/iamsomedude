<b>Conversation that goes with Request for Warrant that Corresponds with Or=
der -  Court Order</b><br><br>

Conversation going on before I started taping about using the bible or havi=
ng the spiritual aspects in the court or trying to eliminate it from the co=
urt. =20

R:	The people that we must deal with to show what we=92re dealing with, the=
y only believe in the chemistry.  But you see the invisible man is the elec=
trical charge that is in the chemistry which is the attractive force that h=
olds all the cells of your body together to make up your person.<br><br>
**	Well this guy was talking this morning on C-Span that this is like no ot=
her war-- we are at war electronically.  He said everything is about electr=
onics now.<br><br>
R:	Yep!  And digitals too!  It just comes in bits and pieces and nobody kno=
ws what the over all is.  But you see too, if the religious aspect is taken=
 out of it in laying out this side.  I=92m sure he understands the spiritua=
l side.  <br><br>
**	See he wants to totally avoid it because he said it is not in the consti=
tution.<br><br>
R:	Right.<br><br>
**	But I said the Founding Fathers when they set everything up it was based=
 on the bible.<br><br>
R:	Mmhum, but what he=92s saying is that the scriptures tell us not to try =
to proselytize the world and that=92s what it means.  Don=92t go out becaus=
e you can=92t press the so called internal belief on others.  That only com=
es when they need it.  So you see he=92s omitting it.  But here is some of =
the physical reasoning.  See when the Christ went up, he became weightless.=
<br><br>
**	Right.<br><br>
R:	So the 2nd coming is the fall of man.  Because why?... He=92s falling ba=
ck to earth again.  But you see the Christ doesn=92t have a body here, only=
 the body of the person that has accepted him.<br><br>
**	Good explanation.  That=92s bringing more clarification.<br><br>
R:	So you see the rest of the world as a matter of physics they do not reco=
gnize this religious bible =93thumping=94 as some refer to it.  Okay so we=
=92ve started on the track of starting to summon the people into these cour=
ts to where it means to balance the accounts and I just wrote this little s=
hort thought that could go to R*, however your communicating in any paper t=
o them, but I just wrote this out so it sort of applies to everybody.<br><b=
r>
**	Okay.<br><br>
R:	It=92s just a one pager that I=92ll fax you.<br><br>
**	I just got something on the email and someone called me the other night =
about some people in Los Angeles area getting arrested for using bills of e=
xchange.  Seems there is a large number.  It wasn=92t on the news and if it=
 was 100 I=92m sure that would have been on the news.  Have you heard this?=
<br><br>
R:	Well you see the bill of exchange is still the bill before you have an o=
rder for the warrant.  It could be reduced to an order and an order is, lik=
e in R*=92s case, is a contempt order.  Okay now I=92ll just run it by you.=
  In the remarks that I was giving to her.  In the civil assessment of the =
case, and see, I=92m doing this like this because she=92s incarcerated.  If=
 you=92re going to do this on paper you want to use your affidavits and stu=
ff, but beings she=92s incarcerated she=92s limited in what she can do in t=
hat regard.<br><br>
**	She could still write an affidavit through could she not?<br><br>
R:	Yeah but she=92ll be doing this on her feet in open court.<br><br>
**	Oh=85 Okay.<br><br>
R:	In the civil assessment of the case, announce a request for the municipa=
l Risk Manager or Mayor of the City of the municipal corporation, wherein t=
his court and employees thereof  are operating, to be summoned to appear in=
 this court with the warrant that corresponds to the said order(s) charging=
 the defendant (name).  You might request the names(s) and address(s) of th=
e said corporate management be provided so that the authorized corporate of=
ficer be summoned to appear with the corresponding warrant(s) that vouch fo=
r the said orders and judge who signed the order(s) for the corporate spons=
or!  In other words a sponsor has to vouch for his employee and that=92s wh=
y we=92re entitled to the subpoena duces tecum to bring that person into co=
urt to match up the order for the warrant.  Se in some cases they=92ll say,=
 =93Well there is already a warrant issued=94  Then you see the person who =
is subpoened duces tecum to the court has got to appear with the order that=
 corresponds with the warrant.  All they did is work it in reverse.<br><br>
**	Oh the inverse trick=85<br><br>
R:	Now these suggestions are for someone who is in custody and limited to t=
he amount of paperwork she/he can do in that circumstance.<br><br>
**	So she can make verbal requests right?<br><br>
R:	Right since the municipal corporations are the sponsors of the Imperial =
Judge in the local court, it is the person of the corporation who must furn=
ish (by subpoena duces tecum) the appearance of the corresponding order or =
warrant, to vouch for the judges signature on the order or the warrant, whi=
ch ever comes second=85. Okay?<br><br>
**	Okay.<br><br>
R:	A minute order would contain the =93seconds=94 would it not?  The order =
and the warrant, put in the same account (mutual account) render the accoun=
t zero.  =96 0.00.  The corporation is the person liable and employees ther=
eof are witnesses.<br><br>
**	Good!  You are going to fax this to me and I=92ll type it up and send it=
 over to R*s husband for him to get it to her.  I=92 just at such a loss or=
 state of confusion trying to put court documents together.  I was going to=
 try to put some understanding in what B* was saying.<br><br>
R:	Well you don=92t want to compromise by putting the pearl before the swin=
e.  See he=92s taking the pearls out and he=92s not going to feed them at t=
he trough because the swine are slopping up the slop so we=92re not going t=
o put any of the pearls in there.  That=92s what he=92s doing basically and=
 that=92s probably why he=92s successful where other people aren=92t that a=
re very similar.<br><br>
**	He basically tells the court this is =91my court=92 and sets it up becau=
se he is the sovereign by his actions and the judge becomes the referee and=
 if the judge tries to take control he holds the judge in contempt.  He bas=
ically thinks of it as common law.<br><br>
R:	Yeah=85 I know.<br><br>
**	He thinks that you don=92t have the foundation because you=92re not deal=
ing with the constitution and I told him you have the strongest foundation =
because yours is internal and the foundation of everything.<br><br>
R:	Well you see this is the way to bring this out.  We happen to know we ha=
ve the redeemer and see the person like B* and he would have to understand =
it.  Maybe he isn=92t consciously doing it but subconsciously he realizes t=
hat.<br><br>
**	Right!  He was just trying to point out that the spiritual learning has =
no place in court.  I think the whole court system is based on a confidence=
 game so you better realize the power of within.<br><br>
R:	Yeah you see the =93minute order=94 I can see is al order that they assu=
me pulls together.  In other words the minute order is the attractive force=
.  Why?... because the minute order has the =91seconds=92 =96 or the second=
ary market..?  or the re-tail..,?.=97the tail end.  So you see all these th=
ings start to fit.  <br><br>
**	Yes it is all coming together if we can hold together.  You almost have =
to be able to see things from an abstract point of view to see it in its en=
tirety.<br><br>
R:	But this for R* should be fairly simple if she asks the judge or the pro=
secutor for the names of these people and/or even to instruct the clerk of =
court to issue a subpoena duces tecum to these particular corporate officer=
s to appear at the court that will be with the warrant that corresponds wit=
h the order.  Then they=92ll have to take the order and then they=92ll have=
 to take the value of it out there and put it on the check because a check =
is a warrant.  See that=92s what the judge is going to have to have to vouc=
h for his signature.  So this should sum it up.<br><br>
**	Good!  Okay I=92ll get on it.

<b>Faxed document</b>

Request Warrant that Corresponds with Order (Court)<br><br>

In the civil assessment of the case, announce a request for the municipal R=
