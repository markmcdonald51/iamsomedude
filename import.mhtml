Under Article 1 Section 9 of the United States Constitution, there exists a=
n excise tax on the importation of your "property" (person) into the United=
 States of America which is the MANIFESTATION of "kingdom of heaven" here o=
n earth, but right now we cannot enter that kingdom, <i>=93For assuredly, I=
 say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by=
 no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled",</i> so right now we (as=
 heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ) are stuck in the UNDERWORLD (Land o=
f Saturn (Satan)/ imagination land) as if we were the BODY OF CHRIST (legal=
 title) for <i>=93we share in his sufferings in order that we may also shar=
e in his glory=94</i> until the SPIRIT OF CHRIST (equitable title) unites w=
ith the BODY OF CHRIST (legal title).<br><br>

Once the lien resulting from the importation of the person (NAME =3D CHRIST=
) into the "underworld" (land of Saturn (Satan) / imagination land) is sett=
led, then you can reunite the SPIRIT OF CHRIST (equitable title) with the B=
ODY OF CHRIST (legal title) and now the BODY and SPIRIT of CHRIST are UNITE=
D (within the same body of being) allowing CHRIST (NAME) to rise from the d=
ead for <i>"be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of li=
fe"</i> and pursuant to Article 1 Section 9 of the United States Constituti=
on there is a 10$ EXCISE TAX placed upon that PERSON so IMPORTED (property =
so imported: equitable interest).<br><br>

So, the man: represented by the ColB/initial registration, accepts CHIRST (=
BC NAME / SLAVE / SERVANT / PASSTHRU) and REMITS HIS DEBTS (assigns interes=
ts) to CHRIST in order CHRIST REMIT those SINS (assigns debts) to GOD (via =
the SS ACCOUNT) for ABSOLUTION (zero out the debt) allowing for man to rece=
ive SALVATION (freedom from the burden) of SIN (debt) through CHRIST (NAME)=
.<br><br>

This is guaranteed thru Article 1 Section 10 which prohibits any interferen=
ce with a contract for the Colb/BC combo is a contract under seal of state =
wherein one could escape or emancipate themself from servitude by and thru =
settling the lien against the person imported by way of ADOPTION BY REGISTR=
ATION of BIRTH EVENT creating an EXCISE TAXABLE EVENT of which is imposed L=
AWFULLY thru the Constitution and allows the STATUTORY LEINS and CREATURES =
OF STATUTE to attach to your interests (estate) and  allows those same STAT=
UTORY CREATIONS to ADMINISTRATE those interests and if a man's interests ar=
e subject to ADMINISTRATION, then the man is subject to ADMINISTRATION.<br>=

<i>"<b>It is significant that the words slave and slavery are not used in t=
he Constitution of 1787, and that the Framers used the word person rather t=
han property.</b>  This would assure, as Madison explained in The Federalis=
t No. 54, that <b>a slave would be regarded `as a moral person, not as a me=
re article of property.</b>'  It was in the context of the slave trade deba=
te at the Constitutional Convention that Madison argued that it was <b>`wro=
ng to admit in the Constitution the idea that there could be property in me=
n.'</b><br><br>

 "Although Southern delegates hoped opposition would weaken with time, the =
practical effect of the clause was to create a growing expectation of feder=
al legislation against the practice.  Congress passed, and President Thomas=
 Jefferson signed into law, a federal prohibition of the slave trade, effec=
tive January 1, 1808, the first day that Article I, Section 9, Clause 1, al=
lowed such a law to go into effect."  (See Matthew Spalding, The Heritage G=
uide to the Constitution, p 151.)<br><br>

The Founders wanted to stop slavery but knew the abolition of it would take=
 time.  Meanwhile, they allowed import taxes to be imposed.  "<b><font colo=
r=3D"red">Import taxes were both a revenue-raising device and a means of re=
gulating the kind and quality of persons coming into the country.</font>  T=
he southern states agreed to a tax to cover expenses of an inspection to ex=
clude convicts and undesirable persons, but insisted that the tax be limite=
d to $10 so that it would not become prohibitive and restrict importation a=
ltogether.</b>"  (See Skousen, The Making of America, p 471.)   <a href=3D"=

http://causeofliberty.blogspot.com/2012/01/slavery.html</a></i><br><br>

This is the hidden lien for the EXCISE TAX on the IMPORTATION of your PERSO=
N by way of ADOPTION, keeping your PERSON from being united with CHRIST for=
 none <i>"... will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled"</i>=
 and failing to ADDRESS this lein will be considered as rejecting the kingd=
om as we are all ADOPTED SONS OF GOD and CREATION IS WATING FOR US TO REVEA=
L OURSELVES.<br><br>

<b><u>Keep in mind:</u></b> While each one of us shall be redeemded without=
 money, nor perishable such as gold and silver, your PERSON shall not for G=
od does not respect PERSONS, but in Satan's world, IMAGE OF GOD is not resp=
ected, thus one must act AS IF one were the PERSON and now the EXCISE TAX m=
ust be accounted.

The following was in letter from Vital Statistics and they are ADAMANT they=
 only register and record the EVENT which gives rise to the EXCISE TAX for =
the IMPORTATION of your PERSON (property) into the UNITED STATES by way of =
operation of law under Lieber Code article 134, 38, and 7 for this action s=
erves to secure and underwrite loans from the IMF / FEDERAL RESERVE and sho=
uld be the case in every country that utilizes the world reserve currency: =
The US Dollar which in effect, serves to IMPORT the PERSON of the inhabitan=
ts of the world into the United States as COLLATERAL in exchange for =93loa=
ns=94 and =93aid=94 from the IMF.<br><br>

<u>Dep't of Envtl. Reg. v Falls Chase Special Taxing District 424 So. 2d 78=
7 (Fla 1st DCA 1982)</u>, <i>"an agency has only such power as expressly or=
 by necessary implication is granted by legislative enactment. An agency ma=
y not increase its own jurisdiction and, as a creature of statute, has no c=
ommon law jurisdiction or inherent power such as might reside in, for examp=
le, a court of general jurisdiction"</i><br><br>

As the current occupants are mere agencies created by and through STATUTE, =
there is no ability for the same to act in common law, thus this ten dollar=
 excise tax/lien becomes INVISIBLE because the United States acquired under=
 Article 1 Section 8 Clause 17 by way of necessity (war) these COLLATERAL I=
NTERESTS as =93the commander of an occupying army may require of the civil =
officers of the enemy, and of its citizens, any pledge he may consider nece=
ssary for the safety or security of his army, and upon their failure to giv=
e it he may arrest, confine, or detain them=94. This action by the United S=
tates creates a taxable event for the migration or importation of these =93=
persons=94 (pledge) pursuant to Article 1 Section 9.<br><br>
=20
So, one can ELECT to exercise RIGHT OF REDEMPTION for the annexed tax certi=
ficate (cf. Florida Statute 197.472 (Colb)) and collateral (cf. UCC 9-623 (=
BC PERSON)) for discharge of lien and settlement of the excise tax imposed =
pursuant to Article 1 Section 9 of the United States constitution in accept=
ance of the gift of safe harbor extended by the United States through the a=
doption and importation of this person into the United States via the regis=
tration of the birth event with STATE OF FLORIDA.<br><br>

now, the last "jot and tittle" has been settled and all the law fulfilled a=
nd the kingdom of heaven is now yours to enter; manifest on this earth by t=
he existence of the "STATE"; like the wind, you cannot see it, but you will=
 feel the effects.<br><br>


IT IS THE SAME OPERATION ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN<br><br>

our Father who art in heaven =3D GOD =3D STATE<br>
the son sent to accept our sins =3D CHRIST =3D BC/SSN ACCOUNT NAME<br>
penitent man =3D SINNER =3D COLB / INITIAL REGISTRATION<br><br>
SINNER REMITS SINS TO CHRIST OF WHOM THEN DELIVERS THOSE SINS TO GOD FOR AB=
SOLUTION OF SIN, REDEEMING THE SINNER <br><br>
In private, you have your direct connection with your creator, father, lord=
, or whatever name you choose. <br><br>

In public, the pass thru is a necessity to ensure <b><i><font color=3D"red"=
>a means of regulating the kind and quality of persons coming into the coun=
try remains;</font></i></b> all done in accordance with the WILL OF THE PEO=
PLE that is the Constitution as EXECTUORS for the will of God; built upon d=
ivine Providence.
